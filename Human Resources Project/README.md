### AIM: 
Hiring and retaining employees are extremely complex tasks that require capital, time and skills, Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring. Develop a model that could predict which employees are more likely to quit.

### Apporach:
* First understood how to leverage the power of data science to reduce employees turnover and transform human resources department.

* Second understood the theory behind logistic regression and random forest classifiers.

* Train logistic regression classifier and random forest classifier models using sklearn.

* Apply Sigmoid functions to obtain probability.

* Load and manipulate data set using Panda's dataframe.

* Develop a function in Python and apply it to pandas data frame.

* Perform exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

* Plot kernel density plots, box plots and count plots.

* Convert categorical variables into dummy variables.

* Learn understand the theory and intuition behind artificial neural networks and apply them to perform classification tests.

* Evaluate classification models and present results using confusion matrix and classification reports and understand the difference between precision recall and F1 score.

# Theory

## Logistic regression
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

## Random forest
The random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that randomly creates and merges multiple decision trees into one “forest.” The goal is not to rely on a single learning model, but rather a collection of decision models to improve accuracy. The primary difference between this approach and the standard decision tree algorithms is that the root nodes feature splitting nodes are generated randomly.
